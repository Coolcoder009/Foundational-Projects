Data explorations like data.head(), data.tail(), data.describe(), data.info(), getting unique values in a column
Using regular expression to preprocess the content
Using various nlp models provided by nltk -> stemmer, stopwords, tokenizer
Stemming -> making word to it's base form 
Stopwords -> words such as "in" "at" doesn't contribute so using this corpus we can remove 
Tokenizer -> make words from sentences 
TF-IDF vectorizer
TF -> How often a word occurs in a doc. High freq says greater importance
IDF -> Increasing the weight of rare words
